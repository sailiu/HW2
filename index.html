	<h2>About Saiyin</h2>
	
	<p>I was born in 1992, in a small town, like no where, in mid-north part of China. I suffered for 12 years 
	from Chinese eduction system, which put too much pressure on students. I moved to a mid-sized city called YinChuan, 
	where I met My first foreign friend named Regan, who helped me initialized my study aboard plan.</p>
	
	<p>I came to the United state in 2011, as a student of the University of Iowa. Things are not as what I have expected, 
	because I felt more pressure then when I was in China. I thought about drop the school, but I do not know what to do
	after that. I was just living, in the first two years. However, I suddenly realized that life is about under certain
	pressure and make it better. So I decided to double major in Finance and Information System, and graduate in the good miner.
	I have one and a half semester left, so I will work harder, and hopeful I could find a job that I am satisfied with.</p>

	<p>My real life is about to start</p>
